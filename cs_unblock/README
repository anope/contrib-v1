This module will remove offensive modes (modes that prevent users from joining (-ilk)) from channels. This module bypasses MLOCK.
However, this module isn\'t a substitute to UNBAN, which should be used first before trying to enter the channel.
Use of this module on UnrealIRCd doesn\'t really have any effect, as [i]/cs invite[/i] will override any modes preventing users from joining. On IRCds where the INVITE command doesn\'t override any other modes except i, this module can be used.

Version 0.1 supports Anope 1.8.4
