Whenever a user is added to the channel access list or, his access being changed or his access deleted from the channel access list, ChanServ will send them a notice informing about their access status (whether (s)he is added, changed or deleted, by whom, which channel and at what levels). If the user is offline during the events, a memo will be sent to the user informing about the events.
