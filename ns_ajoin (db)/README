This module allows users to maintain a servers-side list of channels they wish to join upon identifying.
The ajoin settings can be configured for each nick group through SET AJOIN.
This module adds the AJOIN commannd and SET AJOIN option to nickserv.

To use this module, the IRCd must support SVSJOIN.
At the time of writing this module will only properly work with following IRCDs:
 - InspIRCd
 - Plexus 3.0 [or later]
 - PTLink
 - UltimateIRCd 2.8.2 [or later] [Excluding 3.x]
 - Unreal 3.1.1 [or later]
 - Unreal 3.2 [or later]
 - ViagraIRCd 1.3.x [or later]

I wrote this module because the other 2 alternatives (addon module by DukePyrolator and ns_ajoin by Scott) are outdated or require MySQL, which i - like many other people probably - do not use / want to use.

The database subroutines have been ported from swhois by Trystan,
I would not have been able to pull this off without those...

Note that this module should be placed in ModuleDelayedAutoload.

Version 4.2.2 supports Anope 1.8.0
