Allows Anope to check connecting users against DNS blacklists and ban them if necessary. To install on Linux, extract the .tar.gz file and copy the folder to src/modules, then make && make install. To install on Windows, extract the .tar.gz file and copy m_dnsbl.dll to the Anope module folder.

To configure, add the following two configuration items:
DNSBlacklists, a space separated list DNS blacklists, eg:
DNSBlacklists "dnsbl.dronebl.org rbl.efnetrbl.org"
and DNSBanTime, the time to place bans for, which defaults to 4 hours.

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.5
Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.8.5
Version 1.2 supports Anope 1.8.6
