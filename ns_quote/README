This module sends a quote to a user who identifies.

Can be configured to allow the [i]/ns cookie[/i] command (See ns_quote.c)

This is an edit of an older module: ns_fortunecookie.

The cookies.conf file needs quotes added. I only supplied two for testing purposes.

Tested on Anope 1.8.7

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.5 to 1.8.7
