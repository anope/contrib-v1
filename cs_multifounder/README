This modules allows you to have multiple founders per channel.
Each founder will get access level 10000, automatic +qo when entering/identifying and will have access to ALL founder commands.

WARNING!!!!! 
EACH FOUNDER WILL BE ABLE TO DELETE OTHER FOUNDERS!!!! 
ONLY GIVE FOUNDER STATUS TO PEOPLE YOU REALLY TRUST!!!
WARNING!!!!!

This module will cause the channel founder to shift to the founder that needs it at that moment, and thus it will make the channel info a bit unreliable.
It still has some small bugs, like not correctly removing founders, but reducing their access level to 0.

Any questions/ideas/bugs? Feel free to contact me.
(Do NOT leave comments about this, comments are meant for feedback about the module, not for requests.)

EDIT: a .dll version is coming soon, thanks to chaz.
