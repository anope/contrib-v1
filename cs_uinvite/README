This module allows a user to invite themselves or other users to a channel, unlike /cs invite, where you can only invite yourself.

You MUST have INVITE access on the channel you are inviting you/others into.

Syntax: /cs uinvite user #channel.

This module has been tested with Anope 1.8.0 and Anope 1.8.0-rc1. Please leave me a comment if it works on any other revisions.

Any problems with the module, leave me a comment.

This module has no configurable option.

Version 1.0.0 supports Anope 1.8.0
