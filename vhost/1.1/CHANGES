	A	command to /hs: config, read /hs help config for instructions.
	A	internal regex list for stopping forbidden vhost requests.
	A	vhost bot, reporting everything happening around vhosts
	A	timer showing open vhost requests in the channel, delay defaults to 3600s = 1 hour
	F	virtual hostname can actually be 63 chars long now instead of 62.
	F	missing check for services admins. Dropping another users nick would
		1) not remove that nicks request from db
		2) instead remove the SA's request if there was one.
	C	auto set vhost to user on activation, no more memo with '/hs on' instructions
