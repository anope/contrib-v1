Anope Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

1) Installing vhost
2) Starting vhost
3) Configuration Directives

Note: You should also read the README file!

1) Installing vhost

	The very first thing you need to do is to get the Anope package (if not already done).
	You can find it at:

        http://www.anope.org/
		
	Make sure to get the latest stable release, atleast Anope-1.7.21. Note that Anope-1.9.0
	and above is NOT supported. Follow install instructions.
	
	Next, put the following provided files in your Anope data directory (by default, ~/services):
	
		* hs_request.db
		ATTENTION: If this file already exists, which it probably will, do NOT replace it!
				Otherwise you will loose any existing vhost requests.
		* hs_request.regex.db
		* hs_request.exempt.db
		
	Now put the extracted vhost directy (/vhost) under your Anope package directory in the modules directory (=> /anope-1.8.x/src/modules/vhost).
	
	You can now type 'make modules' to compile vhost. If you see errors during this process, please
	email me with the *complete* error output, and don't forget to mention your OS, compiler and
	C library versions. Next type 'make install' to install vhost.
	
	Go back into the data directory. Open services.conf with your favorite text editor and copy the
	configuration directives from 3) to services.conf. Read the instructions contained in those
	directives carefully. If you changed the original HSRequestDBName make sure to change
	vhsDBName to the same filename. Then search for the ModuleDelayedAutoload directive and replace
	'hs_request' with 'vhost'.
	
	Once you are satisfied, reload the configuration file if anope is already running (/msg operserv reload).
	
2) Starting vhost

	Besides adding vhost to services.conf you can also load and unload vhost on the fly by typing '/msg operserv modload vhost' and '/msg operserv modunload vhost', respectively.
	
3) Configuration Directives

	vhost does not use old hs_request entries. Make sure to mirror changes made to default settings
	when switching from hs_request to vhost.
