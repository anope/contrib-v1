	vhost uses modified functions from Anope-1.7.21. All copyrights reserved.
	
2) Presentation

	Originally, hs_request adds request and activate functionality to HostServ that allows
	users to request virtual hostnames and administrators to manage such requests. As great
	a tool it is its feature set is limited and not as accessible as one would hope for.
	vhost builds on and extends the original feature set provided by hs_request, provides a
	rich set of more powerful and more directly accessible ways to display and manage virtual
	hostnames to administrators and in effect completely replaces the original module.
	
	A new representation of the HostServ-Service is added to the networks userlist (providing
	ip cloaking is supported):
	
		* vhost, a channel bot that helps managing virtual hostname requests. It displays useful
		  information for every request and handles some often encountered situations such as, but
		  not limited to, request and re-request spam automatically.
		
	vhost currently works with:
	
		* Hopefully every daemon supported by Anope. However it has only been tested on
		  UnrealIRCd 3.2.6 and later
		* Anope-1.7.21 and upwards, tested until Anope-1.8
		
3) Features

	Besides inheriting all original commands and features from hs_request, vhost offers many
	additional features:
	
		* Management and Announcement Bot 'vhost', keeps everyone updated on open requests and
		  allows access to activation/rejection-related commands, type !vhost in channel for
		  a list of available options.
		  If enabled pre-compile, users can be matched using wildcards and regex strings.
		* Enhanced Request Verifier, making sure only valid requests are accepted and relayed
		  for approval. Validity-checks include checks against an on-the-fly modifiable list of
		  regex strings. Default strings disallowing any valid .tlds (as of feb10) and valid IPs
		  or IP look-alikes are provided.
		  Often encountered situations such as a user
		  
			* repeating his request to 'speed up' the verification process
			* wanting to change host capitalisation
			* using vhost requests instead of /hs GROUP to synch the vhost for grouped nicks
			* abusing vhost requests for ban-evading
			* ...
			
		  are dealt with automatically and transparently. Although not all events are broadcasted
		  openly, everything happening will be logged and displayed in a channel specified in
		  Anopes' LogChannel (by default, '#services') if enabled.
		  Besides opers, who are exempted from all checks, special exemption can also be granted
		  on a per-user basis. This exemption propagates to all grouped nicknames. The level of
		  exemption can't currently be specified, it's either all or nothing.
		* Shortcuts, why type more if you can type less?
		* Mass Activation/Rejection Capability
		* Automatic Host Setting on Activation
	
	Likely not everything will be covered by this document, just try it out and see for yourself. :)
	Detailed information on individual commands are provided, type '/msg hostserv help' for starters.

6) Contact

	If you read the documentation carefully, and didn't find the answer to your question,
	feel free to join me on irc (irc.immortal-anime.net #help). Note that this is an
	official Support channel for the Immortal-Anime IRC network. Therefore when reporting a
	bug or asking a question be as precise as possible and make clear you are talking about
	vhost, because they have no extraordinary powers and certainly can't guess things if
	they aren't provided. The more precise you are, the sooner you'll be likely to get an
	answer.
	
	If you think you found a bug, report it on irc or send me an email. Also say wether the
	bug happens always or under what circumstances, and anything that could be useful to
	track your bug down. If you wrote a	patch, send it over.
