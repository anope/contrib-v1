This module will restrict the SET SUPERADMIN command to Services Root Administrators while leaving other SET commands accessible for regular SA\'s.

[b]As of Anope-1.7.20 the OperServ SET command has been restricted to Services Root, thus limiting access to SET SUPERADMIN as well.
As a result this module is no longer required when running an up-to-date version of Anope.[/b]

Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.7.18
