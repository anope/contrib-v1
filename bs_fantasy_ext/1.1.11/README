This Version: 1.1.11
Up-to-Date with Anope 1.7 Revision 1192

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires: Anope 1.7.16
Tested: Anope 1.7.17 + UnrealIRCd 3.2.5 (Should work on any IRCd)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
-------------
This module can add commands to the botserv fantasy engine, as well as override some of the
allready present commands to extend their functionality.
This module combines some functions of the old bs_fan, bs_fantasy and bs_moremodesperline,
while adding some new features as well. The more modes per line functionality allows up to
6 users on one line (for example: !op user1 user2 user3 user4 user5 user6).
A new feature added in Version 1.1.11 is a more complex implementation of kickban.
For example: !kb *@*.be will add a ban on *!*@*.be and kick all users matching the ban.
If a user is present who matches the gives host and is protected, the process will be aborted.

Unlike previous versions of these modules, this module has been written for 
Anope1.7.x (1.7.13+) and higher and will NOT work on any version pre 1.7.16. There will not be 
made a version made for the older 1.6 branche since this branch will become to outdated 
when 1.7 becomes stable. Also, this module has been created to replace the old module that
allready existed for the 1.6 branch, this one though has slightly different options and cmds.
Except for the latest development version of Anope, this module comes 'as is', meaning i do
not officially support this modules with any other version of Anope then the latest 1.7 release.
I will not offer any support either if you have RAW enabled on your network (so don't even 
bother asking).

This module no longer uses a lot of code from SGR's original bs_fantasy module, nor from
ProjectDEAD's original bs_fan module code, though many of the ideas are based on theirs.
Therefor the credit for coming up with many of the ideas goes to them.
There are on the other hand entire code blocks that were copied with minimal changes 
from the Anope core so a lot of the credit the Anope Development crew.
I also want to thank Rob (actually the entire Dev Crew) for helping me through some hard
parts during development and especially Trystan, who did a wonderful job helping me out with 
some of my memory leak problems.
