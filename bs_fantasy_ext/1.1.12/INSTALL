#ListExempNick ""

# OverrideCoreCmds [OPTIONAL]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# Override the fantasy commands implemented by the Anope Core to add extra functionalities
# like multiuser commands support (up to 6 users/line). If this is set, you can unload bs_fantasy.
# This will also override the !kb implemented by the core so you can also unload bs_fantasy_kickban.
# To enable this comment this line out. The 1 does not influence the setting ( so changing it to 0 won't work),
# it s there to make sure the directive is parsed.
#OverrideCoreCmds 1 

# EnOperCmds <option> [OPTIONAL] [DISCOURAGED]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# This will enable IRC operator fantasy commands in all channels with botserv fantasy
# commands enabled. IRCops will not need the the fantasy access level to that channel,
# but if OSOpersOnly is set they will need to be opered to be able to use it.
# Note that if access to this command is granted to all Services Opers (3), access
# may still be denied later on depending on the command issued.
# Using this is discouraged because of the high risk of power abuse by opers.
# By default this is disabled.
# Possible Option Values:
# 0 - Disabled
# 1 - Enabled for Services Root Administrators
# 2 - Enabled for Services Admins (and above)
# 3 - Enabled for Services Opers (and above)
#EnOperCmds 0 

# SAdminOverride [OPTIONAL] [DISCOURAGED]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# This will allow Services Root Administrator and Services Admins to use the fantasy
# commands to override channel settings and modes the same way they can use regular
# ChanServ commands.
# Using this is discouraged because of the high risk of power abuse by opers.
# To enable this comment this line out. The 1 does not influence the setting ( so changing it to 0 won't work),
# it s there to make sure the directive is parsed.
#SAdminOverride 1
