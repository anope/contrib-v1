This module adds commands to the botserv fantasy engine, as well as override some of the already present commands to extend their functionality.

This module combines some functions of the old bs_fan, bs_fantasy and bs_moremodesperline, while adding several new features as well. The more modes per line functionality allows multiple users on one line (for example: !op user1 user2 user3 user4 user5 user6). Additionally, instead of users it will also accept masks (eg: !voice user1 *@mask1 *@mask2).

Among new features in this module are:
- A more complex implementation of kickban.
For example: !kb *@*.be will add a ban on *!*@*.be and kick all users matching the ban. If a user is present who matches the gives host and is protected, the process will be aborted.

- Support for !tb(an) and !tkb. Both of these work similar to the new implementation of !kb.

- !down command accepting a target level.

- and many more. See the command list in the modules README.

Unlike previous versions of these modules, this module has been written for Anope1.8.x and will not be adapted for older or for newer versions. Anope-1.9 will have build-in support for fantasy commands for all regular chanserv commands eliminating the need for this module.

Among Available Commands are:
  - complete and extended !help and !cmdlist
  - !clear
  - !xop (sop/aop/hop/vop)
  - !access & !levels
  - !akick
  - !badwords
  - !set  (Combines both ChanServ and BotServ settings)
  - !bkick  (Modified BotServ kick settings)
  - !topic, !appendtopic & !rappend
  - !staff & !admins
  - !up / !down
  - !ban, !mute/!unmute
  - !kb (With extended capabilities)
  - !tb and !tkb

And for Opers Only:
  - !kill
  - !akill
  - !ignore

And many more...
