Linux Installation Instructions :
-----------------------------------

	- wget the latest version of bs_fantasy_ext (link on Anope forums) 
	  to the anope-1.8.x/src/modules directory
	- extract it with 'tar -zxvf bs_fantasy_ext-1.x.y.tar.gz'
	- If required, change compile time settings in config.h
	- cd to main anope source directory
	- run 'make modules'
	- run 'make install'
	- copy/paste configuration directives below to services.conf (at the bottom
	  there s a section for modules' configuration directives)
	- For autoloading: add 'bs_fantasy_ext' to the ModuleDelayedAutoload directive.
	  Note that the module should be loaded AFTER cs_sync and os_shun if either is 
	  present. So it is recommended to make 'bs_fantasy_ext' the last entry in the
	  ModuleDelayedAutoload directive.
	- load module with /os modload bs_fantasy_ext

Windows Installation Instructions :
------------------------------------------

Installing the module
------------------------
 - Using the pre-compiled version:
As of bs_fantasy_ext 1.2.0 the module consists of more ten just a .dll file. It now has
seperate language files which need to go in data/languages/bs_fantasy_ext. Without
these the module will not load.
The zip file contains a directory structure which needs to be extracted into your 
anope installation directory. Extract or copy the data folder in the zip file to this directory
which also contains the anope.exe. The lang files and the bs_fantasy_ext.dll file will then be
merged into the correct directory.


 - Using the sourcecode:
If you want to compile the module yourself, for example if you want to use a different config.h,
you will first need to compile anope itself for windows.
All instructions on how to compile modules (and anope itself) for windows can be found on the
anope wiki. (http://anope.info/wiki/Windows:Modules)
However as this module is more then just a single file I will explain it in short.
	* Compile anope for windows as explained in the wiki.
	* Extract the sourcecode to a directory bs_fantasy_ext and copy this entire directory to
	  anope-1.8.xx/src/modules so you have a bs_fantasy_ext folder in the modules directory.
	* Open the 'makefile.inc.win32' file in the anope-1.8.xx/src/modules directory as you
	  would normally do to install a module, but instead of adding the sourcecode file to
	  SRCS, you add 'bs_fantasy_ext' to SUBS (you can replace the standard test folder which
	  is already there). This will instruct the compiler to look in the bs_fantasy_ext
	  folder and execute the makefiles it finds there.
	* Return to the sourcecodes root directory anope-1.8.xx/ and run 
	  'nmake -f Makefile.win32 modules' to compile the module.
	  Alternatively, run 'nmake -f Makefile.win32' from within the anope-1.8.xx/src/modules 
	  directory or even from within bs_fantasy_ext/.
	* As the module consists of more then a .dll, it is recommended to use the automatic 
	  install script to copy all files to their appropriate destinations: run
	  'nmake -f Makefile.win32 install' from anopes root directory.
	  For those wanting manually copying: the module needs the bs_fantasy_ext.dll to be copied
	  to the data/modules directory and the (!!!)processed(!!!) language files to 
	  data/languages/bs_fantasy_ext.


Configuring the module
------------------------
In order to configure the module, copy the configuration directives from below to
your services.conf and modify them to suit your needs.


Loading the module
------------------------
Finally in order to load the module issue the '/os modload bs_fantasy_ext' command
and the module should load provided you followed all steps correctly and do
not have any blacklisted modules loaded. (cf README: Technical for more info.)

If you want the module to autoloadon startup, add 'bs_fantasy_ext' to the 
ModuleDelayedAutoload directive. Note however that the module should be loaded 
AFTER cs_sync and os_shun if either is present because bs_fantasy_ext only checks
for their presence on startup. It is therefore recommended to make 'bs_fantasy_ext'
the last entry of the ModuleDelayedAutoload directive.

Configuration directives that should be copy-pasted to services.conf
---------------------------------------------------------------------

# ListExempNick [OPTIONAL]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# Nicks that will never appear in the network staff listing (!staff, !ircops and !admins).
# Wildcards are permitted.
# You can specify more than one nick or wildcard string by separating each one by a space.
# Note that clients on ulined servers will not be shown in the staff listings regardless
# of whether they are in the list or not.
#ListExempNick ""

# IgnoreBots [OPTIONAL]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# When enabled, this option will make bs_fantasy_ext ignore fantasy commands coming from
# users who have usermode +B set.
# Only available on UnrealIRCd3.2 and PTlink.
#IgnoreBots

# OverrideCoreCmds [OPTIONAL]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# Override the fantasy commands implemented by the Anope Core to add extra functionalities
# like multiuser commands support (up to 6 users/line). 
# This will also override the !kb and !unban implemented by the core.
# To enable the extra functionalities uncomment this line, to disable it, leave the line commented out.
#OverrideCoreCmds

# EnOperCmds <option> [OPTIONAL] [DISCOURAGED]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# This will enable IRC operator fantasy commands in all channels with botserv fantasy
# commands enabled. IRCops will not need the fantasy access level to that channel,
# but if NSStrictPrivileges is set they will need to be opered to be able to use it, 
# provided their Services access level is high enough.
# Note that if access to this command is granted to all Services Opers (3), access
# may still be denied later on depending on the command issued.
# Using this is discouraged because of the high risk of power abuse by opers.
# By default this is disabled.
# Possible Option Values:
# 0 - Disabled
# 1 - Enabled for Services Root Administrators
# 2 - Enabled for Services Admins (and above)
# 3 - Enabled for Services Opers (and above)
#EnOperCmds 0

# SAdminOverride [OPTIONAL] [DISCOURAGED]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# This will allow Services Root Administrator and Services Admins to use the fantasy
# commands to override channel settings and modes the same way they can use regular
# ChanServ commands.
# Using this is discouraged because of the high risk of power abuse by opers.
# To enable this, uncomment following line, to disable it, leave the line commented out.
#SAdminOverride

# EnUnbanIP [OPTIONAL] [DISCOURAGED]
# Module: bs_fantasy_ext
#
# This directive has been added because of the possibly abusive behaviour of the !unban command.
# !unban can be used to gradually guess a target users' IP address.
# While i have added several preventive measures to avoid anyone from guessing someone elses IP
# address, I cannot guarantee for 100% that it s impossible.
#
# When defined, the !unban command will be fully operational, with a few restrictions on its use:
# When issueing the command with a target nick...
#   - it can only be used on registered and identified users
#   - it will not remove IP based bans matching the target user if he has NS SET HIDE USERMASK turned on
#   - it may not be used more then three times (set in config.h) (by anyone) on any given user, 
#     unless the users' IP has changed. 
# Keep in mind that the tracking of users' IPs and count is reset when restarting services!
# When not defined, !unban will NOT check IP based bans.
# All other !unban options are unaffected by this setting, so !unban will always work for mask and
# bans matching a users' mask or vhost even if this is not defined.
#
#EnUnbanIP
