# When translating this file to another language, keep in mind that the
# order of parameters for sprintf() is fixed in the source code, so your
# messages need to take the same parameters in the same order as the
# English messages do. If you can't get a natural translation
# of a message without changing the order of the parameters, let me know
# (viper@anope.org) which message is causing a problem and I'll see
# what I can do.
#
#
# Also in help messages, please try to limit line lengths to 90 characters
# of text (not including the leading tab).  This length was chosen because
# it does not cause line wrap under default settings on most current IRC
# clients.  Remember that format characters (control-B, control-_) are not
# included in that 90-character limit (since they don't show on the user's
# screen).  Also remember that format specifiers (%s, etc.) will expand
# when displayed, so remember to take this into account; you can assume
# that the length of a pseudoclient name (ex. %NS replacement) will be eight
# characters, so reduce the maximum line length by 6 for every %xS on a
# line.
#
# To translators or those brave enough to edit this (and risk crashing):
# The following specifiers are available:
#   - %R    Will be translated to "/" or "/msg", depending on UseStrictPrivMsg.
#   - %F    Will be translated to the BSFantasyCharacter.
#   - %NS   Will be translated to the NickServ nick.
#   - %CS   Will be translated to the ChanServ nick.
#   - %OS   Will be translated to the OperServ nick.
#   - %BS   Will be translated to the BotServ nick.
#   - %MS   Will be translated to the MemoServ nick.
#   - %HS   Will be translated to the HostServ nick.
#
# Finally, remember to put a tab at the beginning of every line of text
# (including empty lines).  This has to be a tab, not spaces.

	The LEVELS command allows fine control over the meaning of
	the numeric access levels used for the channel.  With this command,
	you can define the access level required for most administrative functions.
	(The SET FOUNDER and SET PASSWORD commands, as well as this command, 
	are always restricted to the channel founder.) 
	
	LEVELS SET allows the access level for a function or group of functions to be changed.
	LEVELS DISABLE (or DIS for short) disables an automatic
	feature or disallows access to a function by anyone other than the channel founder.
	LEVELS LIST shows the current levels for each function or group of functions.
	LEVELS RESET resets the levels to the default levels of a newly-created channel.
	(See %R%CS HELP ACCESS LEVELS for more info.)
	
	For a list of the features and functions whose levels can be
	set, see HELP LEVELS DESC.
