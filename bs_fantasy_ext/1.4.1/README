This Version  : 1.4.1
Up-to-Date with Anope 1.8 Revision 3112

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires      : Anope 1.8.8

Description:
-------------
This module can add commands to the botserv fantasy engine, as well as override some of the
allready present commands to extend their functionality.
This module combines some functions of the old bs_fan, bs_fantasy and bs_moremodesperline,
while adding some new features as well. The more modes per line functionality allows multiple
users on one line (for example: !op user1 user2 user3 user4 user5 user6).
Additionally, instead of users it will also accept masks (eg: !voice user1 *@mask1 *@mask2).
A new feature added in Version 1.1.11 is a more complex implementation of kickban.
For example: !kb *@*.be will add a ban on *!*@*.be and kick all users matching the ban.
If a user is present who matches the given host and is protected, the action will be aborted.
Another new feature, added in Version 1.1.12, is an implementation of !tb(an) and !tkb. Both
of these work similar to the new implementation of !kb. Therefore use of thus module in 
combination of bs_fantasy_tb should be discouraged, except when this modules' !tb is disabled
in the config.h before compiling the module. (On windows you would have to compile the 
module manually.)
- I am no longer adding every new feature here.. there are simply too many... -

This module no longer uses any code from SGR's original bs_fantasy module, nor from
ProjectDEAD's original bs_fan module code, though many of the ideas are based on theirs.
Therefore the credit for coming up with many of the ideas goes to them.
There are on the other hand entire code blocks that were copied with minimal changes 
from the Anope core so a lot of the credit goes the Anope Development Crew (of which I am now
a member ^_^) .
I also want to thank Rob (actually the entire Dev Crew) for helping me through some hard
parts during early development and especially Trystan, who did a wonderful job helping me out 
with some of my memory leak problems and crashbugs.

This module will not be ported to the new development branch, 1.9, as it will be (at lest partially)
integrated into the anope core. If some of the functionality is not included, I will consider
writing a new smaller module for those bits that were left out.

Installation:
--------------

cf INSTALL.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical:
------------

A few technical need-to-knows and usefull tips about this module

- There are a number of pre-compile configuration options that will allow you to disable
  most of the commands in bs_fantasy_ext without having to touch any of the source code.
  More information can be found in "config.h".
  Note that after changing config.h it may be required to delete bs_fantasy_ext/main.o and 
  bs_fantasy_ext.so from the src/modules directory to force the module to recompile 
  with "make modules".
  To windows users: this option is only available when compiling from source!

- This modules' behaviour may change depending on what other modules are loaded.
  For example if os_shun is loaded the !shun and !tshun command will become available.
  I implemented it this way because i do not want to create a fantasy command that has no "normal"
  counterpart.
  !sync will become available when cs_sync is loaded.

- While i generally refrain from integrating other 3rd party modules in mine, this modules
  behaviour will change to reflect the extra restrictions made to the core when cs_restrict_kb
  is loaded. This module by n00bie restricts the use of CHANSERV kick/ban by normal users against 
  Services Operators and above. bs_fantasy_ext will also adopt this behaviour when the module
  is detected. With one change however: channel founders are still able to kick/ban SO's, but
  none of the above.

- The module will attempt to unload unneeded core modules, more precisely: bs_fantasy, bs_fantasy_kick
  bs_fantasy_kickban and bs_fantasy_unban. It should automatically reload them when the module
  is unloaded or OverrideCoreCmds is disabled, however it may be a good idea to check this.
  Note that bs_fantasy_unban is NOT be automatically reloaded as this is no longer considered
  a core module.
  This functionality is NOT available on WINDOWS systems.

- Note that "!unban <nick>" will not allow you to remove bans matching users by real host or by IP.
  Only bans matching users by cloaked host or virtual host will be removed.
  This restriction does not apply to IRC operators or when the !unban command is used on yourself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loading Restrictions:
-----------------------

As of bs_fantasy_ext 1.1.13 (RC2) some pre-loading checks are performed to change the behaviour
of this module and (if applicable) enable more functionality. Hoewever I also added some
restrictions regarding what other modules/functionality may be enabled.
Currently this only affects the use of RAW, however for the next versions I might look into adding
third party modules to this list that have the same effect as using RAW. 

As of version 1.1.16 additional checks have been added for third party modules that may cause
cause desyncs and in combination with which I refuse to support this module.
The presence of these modules is however not fatal and will only result in bs_fantasy_ext
switching to unsupported mode instead of disabling the entire module as is done with os_raw.
The modules currently on this blacklist are: ircd_init, cs_join, bs_logchanmon, ircd_gameserv, 
cs_joinservices, ircd_vhostserv, os_staychan, os_psuedo_cont and os_clientjoin.
All of these modules ended up on the list because they introduce new services clients,
join them to channels and do not respect the BSMinUsers setting.
(This can cause a channel to "die" internally, but still exist according to the ircd.)

Since I am aware that a lot of people use these modules or can't live without RAW (no-one has so
far given me a valid reason to do so however), I have added a pre-compile directive (SUPPORTED)
in config.h which can disable these sanity checks. 
Be aware though that when you disable (undefine) this directive you will LOSE ALL SUPPORT I
am willing to provide for this module.
Note that even though bs_fantasy_ext still runs in combination with non-fatal modules, 
it is recommended to compile bs_fantasy_ext in unsupported mode if you use these modules.

To Windows users: this WILL REQUIRE YOU TO COMPILE THE MODULE YOURSELF !!!
For obvious reasons, I won't be distributing an unsupported version myself...

Translation:
-------------

If wish to translate this module into a language that is not yet available, or update an existing
translation, get in touch with me on IRC (irc.anope.org #anope) and will tell you what exactly you
have to do. It is not hard, you don't need coding skills of any kind, just a bit of patience.

If you have allready made a translation and are willing to share it, mail the <language>.l file
to me at Viper@Anope.org and it will be included in the next release.

Contact:
---------

I (Jan Milants aka Viper) can be contacted through mail at Viper@Anope.org or through IRC on the 
Anope support network (irc.anope.org #anope). I prefer people contact me through IRC and please ask
me before PM'ing me for a simple question, other people in the channel might be able to answer as well.
I also watch the Anope forums ( http://forum.anope.org ), so if there is any problem and you
can't reach me on IRC, please try using the forums before mailing me.

If you think you found a bug in my module, either post it on the forums, in the thread
related to this module in the section Modules or mail me the details. Pleas do NOT bother
the Anope Development crew with bugs in this module as they are NOT resposible for something
they did not write and prefer modules to be maintained by their authors.
