This is just an adaptation of of MrStonedOnes version, but put into C++ and pretty much copied from the source.

At this point I\'m sure that it works with 1.9.0_p1 and 1.9.1_p1 but no other versions have been tested. If it does work for you in other versions let me know.

Version 2.1.0 supports Anope 1.9.0
Version 2.2.0 supports Anope 1.9.1
