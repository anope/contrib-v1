This module allows for non-opers to request for services bot similar to hs_request and sends memo's to all services operators (configurable) for approval or rejection.

You can find unreleased beta versions in my module directory under my [url="http://git.stacksmash.net/Justasic/tree/Modules/Anope"] Git repository [/url] if I have not updated them here.

This command adds the following Nodes to Anope 1.9:
 /msg BotServ Request  - botserv/request
 /msg BotServ Activate - botserv/activate
 /msg BotServ Reject   - botserv/reject
 /msg BotServ Waiting  - botserv/waiting

and the following Configuration variables:
