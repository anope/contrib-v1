This module adds the SAGROUP command to NickServ allowing Services Administrators and Services Root Administrators to remotely group nicknames.

This module is particulary useful in combination with ns_group_operonly and can also be used to grant users more nicks then NSMaxAliases.


SAGROUP will never work on registered users that have Services Root!

Note that this command overrides several restrictions enforced by the regular GROUP command, including NSNoGroupChange and NSMaxAliases.
!!! USE WITH CAUTION !!!

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.21
