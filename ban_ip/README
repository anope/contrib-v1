This module is my first code, it comes from ipadd_module and I thank his author David Chafin for his little module which helps me well
It's designated for use on UnrealIRCd networks too.
It allows any Services Admin to use the command !banip X.X.X.X to add a new IP to the ban ip block. 
Ban ip blocks are more useful than use of /gline /zline or other because if the server restarts the ban will be still active and the intruders are disconnected before joining a channel
This module have no configurable option.

Version 0.1 supports Anope 1.7.16
