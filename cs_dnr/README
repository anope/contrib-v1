Adds support for wildcarded channels that can\'t be registered, through the use of a \'do-not-register\' list.

This module is based on the do-not-register commands in [url=\"http://www.srvx.net\"]srvx[/url], and as such some code is taken from the project @ [url=\"http://www.srvx.net\"]http://www.srvx.net[/url].

Hash table headers used are available from [url=\"http://uthash.sourceforge.net\"]http://uthash.sourceforge.net[/url], but have also been bundled with the module. They should be placed in anope-dir/include.

If a user attempts to register a channel that matches one or more patterns in the do-not-register list, their channel registration will be blocked. 

A staff member attempting to register a DNRed channel will also be blocked, but will be shown the list of matching DNRs responsible.

For now you\'ll need to remove any DNRs matching a registration if you wish to allow the user (or yourself) to register a DNRed channel (and then add them back). A later version may include an override option.

SYNTAX: [b]NOREGISTER [#pattern [reason]][/b]

With no arguments, lists the current do-not-register list.

With only one argument, lists any current do-not-register patterns matching that channel.

With all arguments, adds a do-not-register channel with the specified reason. In this case, the channel name may include * or ? wildcards.

SYNTAX: [b]ALLOWREGISTER <#pattern>[/b]

Searches for, and removes if present, the the specified pattern from the DNR list, enabling the channel to be registered.

Tested on 1.7.17 and 1.8.4

Version 1.00 supports Anope 1.7.17 to 1.8.4
