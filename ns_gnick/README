ns_gnick: Get the display nick of any given nick.
Parts copied from os_access_levels by Adam.

Usage: /msg NickServ GNICK Homura
Returns: -NickServ- GNICK Homura CuleX

Configuration directives:
NSGNickAccess x # Determines access to gnick, where x is one of
0 = no checks (everyone)
1 = IRCop only
2 = Services Operator only
3 = Services Administrators only
4 = Services Roots only

Invalid values or not setting the directive at all defaults to 0 (Seeing how users can get the display nick from adding access on channel anyway), but it might make sense to change access on networks with ChanServ restricted to opers only.

Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.8.6
Version 1.2 supports Anope 1.8.6
