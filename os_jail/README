Allows IRC Operators to \"jail\" users by forcing them to part all channels and join a defined Jail Channel.

This activates the fantasy command: !jail <nickname> to allow IRC Operators to use the module.

As of Version 1.1.0 it allows the use of the command: /os jail <nickname> as a suppliment for the fantasy command.

Version 1.1.0 supports Anope 1.8.4
Version 1.0.1 supports Anope 1.8.4
