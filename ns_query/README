This module allows a SRA (Services Root Administrator) to have NickServ send a user a PRIVMSG (or more commonly known as a PM). I don\'t know what the purpose of this module is, I was just asked to make it by midnight_tiger.

Syntax: /ns query user message

This module has been tested only with 1.8.0 and 1.8.0-rc1. If it works with any other Anope revision, please leave me a comment. 

Any problems, leave me a comment.

This module has no configurable option.

Version 1.0.0 supports Anope 1.8.0
