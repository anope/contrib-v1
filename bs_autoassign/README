This module allows Botserv clients to be automatically assigned to newly registered channels. The bot to be auto-assigned can be configured in the services configuration file. If no nick is given, or no bot with that nick exists, no bot will be assigned.

This module is a completely redesigned and rewritten version of the bs_autoassign module by SGR. This version has been designed specifically for the 1.7 branch and will NOT work with the 1.6 branch  and even older 1.7 releases.
 

Version 2.0 supports Anope 1.7.21
Version 2.1 supports Anope 1.8.0
