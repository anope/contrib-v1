 Removes unreal\'s fake lag for any user in the selected channel with CS access above 3
(this is beta, doesn\'t work with xop, doesn\'t check that the user is identified, and doesn\'t remove nolag when user parts channel or is kicked)

EXPERIMENTAL MODULE, USE AT OWN RISK 
I only ported this module because of a few requests, at some point im gonna make a /msg nickserv saset nolag version of this module

default channel is #nolag, channel should be set as restricted access.

channel can be changed by editing the .c file

Version 0.1 supports Anope 1.8.1 to 1.8.5
