This module sends numeric 328, RPL_CHANNEL_URL, to users upon joining any registered channel that has a URL set.

There are no configuration options.

This module should work on all ircds that support numeric 328 or any ircd that blindly forwards unknown numerics such as UnrealIRCd.

Version 1.0.2 supports Anope 1.8.3
