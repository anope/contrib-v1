This module allows a ServiceAdmin to set a channel mode on ALL channels. The module is based on os_amode (Katsklaw) and os_massmode (Sorcerer) for anope-1.8. It was originally a port for the Anope Development series.

There are configuration directives to add for it to work correctly, in v1.3. Read the release notes.

Once loaded ServiceAdmins with the operserv/massmode flag can set modes in all channels using /msg operserv mamode +(-)mode.
Eg. /os mamode +i

Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.9.0
Version 1.2 supports Anope 1.9.2 to 1.9.2
Version 1.3 supports Anope 1.9.5
