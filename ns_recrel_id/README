 This module adds extra functionality to the NickServ RECOVER and RELEASE commands so that if someone executes either command with password and is not already identified for a nick, NickServ will automatically recognize him as owner of the target nickname after changing nick.

 Note that this will only work on networks with NSNickTracking enabled in the services.conf!

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.21
