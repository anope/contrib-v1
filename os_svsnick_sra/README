Limits SVSNICK to services root only.

NOTE: This module bypasses the requirement of SuperAdmin! This means you do not have to be a SuperAdmin to use /os SVSNICK!

NOTE: This module does NOT work on networks with os_raw loaded! If you don\'t like it, then too damned bad! I don\'t owe an explanation to anyone as to why. >:(

Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.8.3
