Simple module to allow users to replace email auth with a captcha from a website.

When a user registers, the timestamp, nick, confirmation code and email address are appended to the specifed filename allowing a php website / captcha or any other method for proving the user is not a bot to be used before they are given the confirmation code.

The following configuration items are required:

CaptchaCodeFile \"tmp.txt\"
CaptchaUserText \"Please visit http://localhost/irc/captcha.php?nick=$nick&email=$email to complete registration ;)\"

optional configuration value: (only available when mysql is present)
CaptchaMysqlDatabase \"captcha\" 


In order to use mysql the MysqlHost, MysqlUser and MysqlPass configuration options must also be specified.
