This module will autoop a user on any channel, like the cs_autovoice.
All commands are the same like cs_autovoice but developed to op the user instead of voice the user.

Could be usefull for #bots or any user who wants to op all users on a specific channel. 

This module is ***no longer supported***
BUG: This Module can crash anope.

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.4
