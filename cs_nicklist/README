This is my fist module (so it contains some parts of [i]mikea\'s[/i] [b]bs_quotes[/b]-module) and it\'s mission couldn\'t be easier:
[b]put the userlists of all channels into a database.[/b]

And that is exactly what it does. To use you have to put the following entries into your services.conf (they should be self-explaining):
-NickMysqlHost
-NickMysqlUser
-NickMysqlPass
-NickMysqlName
-NickMysqlPort

Version 1.3 supports Anope 1.8.0
