[b]Description:[/b]
This module allows BotServ to kick users from a channel with a         predefined reason, making kicking faster for the channel operators ,  and ensuring some kind of consistency as all the channel operators can kick with the same reasons.

[b]Syntax:[/b]
 !kickr [NICK] [KICKER]   or
 !kr [NICK] [KICKER]
[i](for example:   !kickr VisioN badlang  or 
                    !kr VisioN badlang  )[/i]

[b]Kickers List:[/b]
[list]
[*]badlang           Kicks for bad language (insults etc)
[*]caps              Kicks for capital character usage
[*]flood             Kicks for flooding
[*]bold              Kicks for bold character usage
[*]advertise         Kicks for SPAM/advertising
[*]repeat            Kicks for repetition
[*]idle              Kicks for idling (useful for helpchans)
[*]badnick           Kicks for bad nickname
[/list]
[b]Installation:[/b]
This module has configurable options. To configure it read the first lines of bs_fantasy_kickreason.c as it has detailed information about how to do so. That said, it works even if you don't alter the configurable settings , but I suggest that you do.

[i]NOTE: This is my first attempt to make a module so the code
might not be as good as you'd expect. I really want to say a BIG BIG thanks to Viper from the Anope Team who guided me through the whole process of creating the module.[/i]

**  NOTICE ** This module is still in a [b]beta testing stage[/b]. It *should* work fine, but don't whinge if it crashes! A new release will be made when it's stable



Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.0 to 1.8.6
