Adds !911 to botserv bots.

If a user needs an oper badly they could type !911 to notify the opers. When a user types !911 it will tell them help is coming, and alert the opers in the oper channel. 


Before you compile this module, make sure you set
#define operchan \"#opers\"
to the channel you would like to be notified in.


----- In user\'s channel -

AndrewMBP- !911
HelpServ- andrewMBP, all online opers have been alerted. Help should arrive soon.

----- In #opers -
*HelpServ* ATTENTION! Help is needed in #andrew! User: andrewMBP
