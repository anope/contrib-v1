Module blocks registration of nicks matching a config list. Useful to block registration of certain nicks, for example applet guest nicks like [i]Anon|XXXX[/i] or [i]Java|XXXX[/i].

It can also be used to protect nicks starting with admins nick (i.e. [i]lnx85*[/i] prevents registration of all nicks similar, such as [i]lnx85`afk[/i], [i]lnx85`out[/i] and much more...)
