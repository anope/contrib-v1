Allows configuring arbitrary commands with fixed replies.

Configuration:

text { name = "moo"; message = "cow"; }
fantasy { name = "moo"; command = "text"; }

Would reply with "cow" to the !moo fantasy command. You can also use command{} blocks with the command name "text" to place the command on a service. "message" may be multiple lines for multiple replies.

Version 1 supports Anope 1.9.9
