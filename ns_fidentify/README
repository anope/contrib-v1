This module allows for a user to be forced to identify to their nickname or a specified account, the module provides the command nickserv/fidentify
Other commands similar to this one have been made but are usually not kept up to date with the ever growing anope 1.9.
if you would like a beta version of my module you can find it in my [url="http://git.azuru.net/Justasic/tree/Modules/Anope/ns_fidentify.cpp"] git repository [/url]
