This module creates the !redirect command.
The command syntax is  [b]!redirect user #channel reason[/b]
This command makes the user part the current channel and join the channel you specify with the "#channel" argument. Then a notice is shown to that user with the reason you specified. If you do not specify a reason, a default reason will be shown to the user. (Alternative command syntax: [b]!redirect user #channel[/b] )

I initially created this module so Viper disposes of the greeks on our network's english help channel so they become somebody else's problem , but you can use it however you like ;-)

This module is based on Viper's bs_fantasy_fpart (he always makes my life easier!)
