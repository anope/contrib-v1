Module Name   : misc_sqlcmd

Git Repo      : http://vips.hopto.org/gitweb/?p=anope-modules/misc_sqlcmd

This Version  : 3.0.0
Up-to-Date with Anope 1.8 Revision 3037

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires      : Anope 1.8.5
Recommended   : Anope 1.8.5 or higher
Tested        : Anope 1.8.5-git + UnrealIRCd 3.2.8 (Should work on any IRCd)
                Anope 1.8.5-git + InspIRCd 1.2.7

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
-------------

This module allows you to send commands or database manipulation instructions to Anope via a table
in its MySQL database. This allows for indirect two-way communication and manipulation of Anope 
whilst it's running and connected to a network.

The module works by polling every X seconds (default 3) the command table for new instructions.
These instructions are then processed in order they were received, and executed to manipulate
Anopes internal - in memory - database. Anope will than save this changes to the MySQL database
during its next scheduled database save, though many changes may become apparent in the MySQL
database just after they are commited by this module.

This module is based on misc_sqmcmd v.2.0.0 by Heinz.
While the principle of operation and communication remains the same, much of the code
for interacting with the Anope core was rewritten and restructures. The syntax of the commands
received through the MySQL database has also changed significantly so it 's fair to say 
that this version of the module is not compatible with code writing commands to SQL for v.2.0.0.

This module is meant to give external program an interface to interact with the 1.8 branch.
I am the first to admin that sending commands through SQL isn't the ideal way, this module
was the easiest and quickest way to accomplish this with the existing framework and code.
In ideal circumstances reading would be done through MySQL and write operations communicated
to anope over XML-RPC.
The 1.9 branch will feature Live-SQL support. This is not meant to rival that implementation, 
however since 1.9 is likely still a few years away from being stable, this module could help
bridge that gap.

Please note that while these commands will perform certain data integrity checks on
the received instructions and return errors if needed, not everything is checked.
While Heinz's version of this module checked access rights, now only the very basics are checked.
This means that for example it is the responsibility of the interface or external
application to verify a user has the right to add a user to a channel's access list.

A list of all the status codes returned by this module can be found in "misc_sqlcmd_errors.h".

TODO:
 - get those plaintext passwords out of the database.. the external party must pre-encrypt these!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working with the checksum:
----------------------------

The checksum allows the module to verify the integrity of the commands received via MySQL, provided
the checksum salt is kept secret.

Each message stored in the commands table needs a valid checksum to be processed. If a valid
checksum is missing an error will be returned and the command will be disregarded.

Once a command and its parameters have been assembled, the checksum is calculated using the 
following method:

	Take the cmd, params and timestamp field and putting these in a ':' separated string.
	The secret checksum salt (specified in the services.conf) is then appended to this string,
	also using a ':' separator. This resulting string should have following format:
			cmd:params:timestamp:checksum_salt

	The whole string is then MD5 hashed, and stored in the checksum field.

When the module reads the command from the MySQL commands table, it will calculate the
checksum based upon the salt that is configured in services.conf. To be a valid commands, 
both checksums must match.

If the "checksum salt" is comprimised, then the user can manually insert his or her own commands
into the database for anope to execute. The checksum salt is specified in the services.conf file,
and should be kept in a secure location in your website scripts or client program.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example commands:
-------------------

To execute a command inside anope, simple insert an instruction into the commands table.
For example to 'PING' anope:
	INSERT INTO anope_sqlcmd (cmd, params, tstamp, chksum)
			VALUES ('PING', NULL, 1295016551, '08becfb9e985e57062f965b5fd3b0b41');

Alternatively, the SQL file also contains a MySQL function to more easily facilitate
the inserting of new commands in the buffer table. This function will generate the chksum
itself with given salt. A timestamp is optional.
	sql_cmd_add(COMMAND, PARAMETERS, CHECKSUM SALT, UNIX TIMESTAMP)
For example the above insert can be handled by a function call:
	select sql_cmd_add('PING', '', 'qd9sd1DS23hW$Q)01B@Q', 0);
The sql_cmd_add() function will return the ID of the command. This can later be used to check
the status of the operation; whether it was successful or encountered an error.
