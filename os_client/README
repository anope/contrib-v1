This module adds commands to OperServ to allow services operators to add/delete/join/part psuedoclients. There is an option to protect services like ChanServ and NickServ, as well as BotServ bots from this module, in case they are accidentaly \"deleted\" (svskilled).

Clients created by this module WILL NOT be deleted when it is unloaded, so be sure to delete them (unless you want them hanging around) before you unload.
