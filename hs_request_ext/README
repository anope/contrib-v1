This module is a modified version of the hs_request that is shipped with Anope. It provides some extra usefull features such as reporting requests to a channel (other then logchan) and the ability to request a vhost through fantasy commands (unlike ircd_vhostserv which sets them instead of requesting them).

I originally never meant to release this publically, but a few people have asked for functionality like this online, so i ll just publish it .

!!! This module REPLACES hs_request so should not be loaded alongside it !!!

Version 3.3 supports Anope 1.8.0
