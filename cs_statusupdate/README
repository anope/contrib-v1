 This module will update a users\' status on the channel when his entry on the access list is changed.

 Currently this only affects the users main display nick.

 Feature requested by Sausage in bs_fantasy_ext. 
 Decided to put it in a seperate module, but has been tested to work with bs_fantasy_ext.

Version 2.0 supports Anope 1.8.0
