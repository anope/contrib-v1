This module adds COMMUNITY commands to NickServ and ChanServ info displays. It allows net admins to specify if a nick or channel is affiliated with any group/community/commitee on or off the network.


The info is viewable by anyone but can only be added by IRCops.

Example:
 -ChanServ- Information for channel #kats:
 -ChanServ- Founder: kats
 -ChanServ- Description: MEOW!
 -ChanServ- Registered: Jun 29 20:45:55 2007 EDT
 -ChanServ- Last used: Jun 29 21:04:11 2007 EDT
 -ChanServ- [b]Community: Kittens Community[/b]

Version 1.0.2 supports Anope 1.8.3
