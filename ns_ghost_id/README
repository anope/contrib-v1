This module adds extra functionality to the NickServ GHOST command so that if someone executes a ghost with password and is not already identified for a nick, NickServ will automatically recognize him as owner of the ghosted nickname after changing nick.

Note that this will only work on networks with NSNickTracking enabled in the services.conf!

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.21
