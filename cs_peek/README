Adds the PEEK command to ChanServ.

Enables channel operators and network staff to view information about a channel without being in it. Staff overrides (peeking channels they do not have access in) are logged.

Services opers+ are considered staff, along with users with auto op access in the defined \'OVERRIDE_CHAN\'.

This command is based on the PEEK command found in srvx.

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.17
