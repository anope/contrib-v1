This module allows for you to tag a services bot instead of using a fantasy prefix in channels with fantasy commands enabled.
An example syntax would be (lets say you have ChanServ assigned to your channel):

[i]ChanServ, topic This is now the topic for the channel[/i]
[i]Â»Â» ChanServ has changed the topic to: This is now the topic for the channel[/i]

The module requires that you have Fantasy commands enabled or it won't work.

As usual you can find beta versions of the module in my [url="http://git.flux-net.net/Justasic/tree/Modules/Anope"]Git repository[/url] and if you have any problems with the module or you find a bug of some kind, I am almost always in Anope IRC support or you can email me at [url="mailto:Justasic@gmail.com"]Justasic@gmail.com[/url].

Version 1.0.0 supports Anope 1.9.5 to 1.9.7
Version 1.0.1 supports Anope 1.9.8
Version 1.0.2 supports Anope 1.9.8 to 1.9.8
