This module adds a karma system to the botserv functionality.
Karma is stored on a channel by channel basis and the system must be turned on by the channels owner.

Commands:
     !karma on/of    Turns the karma system on and off for the channel.
     !karma [<nick>]       Show karma attributed to nick or current user.
     !karma <nick> ALL     Show karma attributed to nick, including who gave it.
     <nickname>++    Increments karma for given user.
     <nickname>--    Decrements karma for given user.

Karma can only be given to registered nicknames and can only be given by registered users. Karma can be given until the limit defined in the services.conf is reached - by default 1 - and it is possible to define a minimum interval required between successive karma increases/decreases.

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.7
