This module creates the /os redirect command.
The command syntax is  [b]/os redirect user #from_channel #to_channel[/b]
This command makes the user part the [b]#from_channel[/b] and join the [b]#to_channel[/b].

This module was made so my bs_fantasy_redirect module would have an operserv command too.
