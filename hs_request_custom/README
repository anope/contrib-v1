This is a modified version of the default hs_request.c to add an option to PM an Oper or Channel (preferred).

Example:

 [VHOST] New vHost Request: Username: zefie vHost: test.host
 [VHOST] To allow this vHost: /msg HostServ ACTIVATE zefie ~ To reject this vHost: /msg HostServ REJECT zefie

 [VHOST] zefie has REJECTED zefie\'s vHost (No Reason Given)
 [VHOST] zefie has ACTIVATED zefie\'s vHost

It introduces two new config options:

HSSendOperPM # [i]Comment out to disable the feature, but then you may as well just use the original hs_request[/i]
HSSendOperPMDest \"#Opers\" # [i]Channel (or user) to PM notifications to.[/i]

[b]* WARNING *[/b]
This is meant to be used INSTEAD of hs_request. I have not tried loading both simultaneously, but I would advise against it. Please unload hs_request before loading hs_request_custom.

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.18
