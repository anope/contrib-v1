This module will perform an action on a user when he says a certain text in a channel. Dont ask me what this could be usefull for... i wrote this one on request. 

I don't recommend using this as spamfilter, there are better ways to deal with spam than this.

Available Actions: GLOBOPS, KILL, AKILL

Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.7.18
