This module adds 2 fantasy commands to botserv to allow users to set new vhosts on themselves using !vhost or !groupvhost.

This module is meant to replace  n00bie's old ircd_vhostserv which can cause desyncs and only works with UnrealIRCd. This rewrite is a significantly slimmed down version which utilises the botserv fantasy system instead of a dedicated client.
Some extra option were added to allow admins to limit who has access.

Note that I am not personally a fan of this type of functionality as it allows users to evade bans placed on them in channels!
