This module will allow Services Admins to register channels for another user. 
Note that when using SAREGISTER much less restrictions will be enforced upon the registration of a channel: the number of channels already registered under the target users\' account will not be restricted, user does not have to be online/on thet channel, etc...

This module is particularly useful in combination with cs_register_operonly.

Version 1.1 supports Anope 1.8.5
