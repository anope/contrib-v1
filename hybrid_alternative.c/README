Notice for Hybrid 8.x:
Added on 23.12.12
m_services.c is now implemented directly into Hybrid 8.x means you only have to install m_change.c
Read Release info for more info.

Notice for Hybrid 7.x:
This Hybrid Protocol module adds SVSNICK and CHGHOST to Anope to use it in Hybrid IRCD. (Allows Rename's by NickServ and usage of HostServ. But currently Hosts can't be turned off without reconnecting)

you have to compile Hybrid IRCD _with_ m_change.c and m_services.c from contrib folder!

Version 0.1 supports Anope 1.8.5 to 1.8.5
Version 1.0 supports Anope 1.8.7 to 1.8.7
