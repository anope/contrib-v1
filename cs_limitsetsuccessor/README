Limits the use of /msg ChanServ SET #channel SUCCESSOR to one of three user levels:

- Services Roots only
- Services Admins and above
- Services Opers and above

The module has one configuration directive which needs to be placed into services.conf before the module is loaded:

# LimitCSSetSuccessor &lt;level&gt; [REQUIRED]
# Limits the user of /msg ChanServ SET #channel SUCCESSOR
# to the user level specified below.
#
# For services roots only, use "root".
# For services admins and above, use "admin".
# For services opers and above, use "oper".
