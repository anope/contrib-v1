Hello Community,
Here is my first module, inspired by the ipadd_module i rewrote this module to spamfilter.c.
It is programmed to use with Unrealircd and Anope.
Services Admin can use it with this command on IRC !spamfilter www.example.com to add a new spam entry to the spamfilter.conf block. 

This module was tested on Unreal3.2.* and Anope1.8.6

Version 1.0.0 supports Anope 1.8.6 to 1.8.6
Version 1.0.1 supports Anope 1.8.6 to 1.8.6
Version 1.0.2 supports Anope 1.8.6 to 1.8.6
Version 1.0.3 supports Anope 1.8.6 to 1.8.6
