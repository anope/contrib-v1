This module makes it possible to use a botserv bot as an eggbot, infobot or zbot like client by allowing it to respond to programmable triggers which can be dynamically controlled.

The modules supports both channel level triggers, controlled by channel staff, and network wide triggers controlled by network staff.

Additionally, this module allows for the use of arguments within the replies and enables conditions to be specified, both on sections within a reply and on entire replies.
An example for this would be replying differently to "?paste" and "?paste <paste_id>".

A more detailed description of the featureset can be found in the modules' headers and the help system ('!help dt' and 'help gdt').
