This module lets you change channel modes for a user in specific channels. For example, /msg NickServ AWAY would set +v-o (or +v-h) for the user in all of his/her channels that have ChanServ AWAYBACK option as ON, similarly /msg NickServ BACK sets back +o-v (or +h-v). It can also set and unset +a and +q if SETAQ is defined in the source (on by default).

Provides commands:
ChanServ AWAYBACK #channel [on/off]
NickServ AWAY [#channel1,#channel2...]
NickServ BACK [#channel1,#channel2...]
NickServ FAWAY nick [#channel1,#channel2...]
NickServ FBACK nick [#channel1,#channel2...]

Version 1.1.1 supports Anope 1.7.21
