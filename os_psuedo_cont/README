Base of this module is derived from two seperate modules. 
os_client.c by: mastergamer - editable psuedoclients
os_clientjoin.c by: SGR - mass services join/part

Allows IRCops to create/join/part/delete psuedoclients
Syntax: CLIENT (JOIN|PART) #chan // note: also works for services/botserv bots 
Syntax: CLIENT ADD nick ident host realname    
Syntax: CLIENT DEL nick - deletes a psuedoclient  // core services are protected
Syntax: CLIENT (SJOIN|SPART) #chan - mass-join/part services psuedoclients
Syntax: CLIENT (BSJOIN|BSPART) #chan - mass-join/part botserv psuedoclients
Services clients have been protected from this module and cannot be deleted.
  
TESTED ON: Anope 1.8.0 - Unreal3.2.8.1
