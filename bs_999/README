Hi, some of the IRC networks out there today are runned by British users. I've noticed there is only a 911 call on here but the uk don't use that. I figured, why would British users wanna use !911? I know, it's stupid but some people really do moan over these simple things. I made a module that uses 999 instead of 911 and will alert the network operators a bit better. Instead of noticing the operator channel, it calls the word "oper" about 5 times and tells the opers the channel and nick needing help. 
Example:
[22:10] <OperServ> oper oper oper oper oper
[22:10] <OperServ> ATTENTION! Help is needed in #Technoid! User: Jackster35

It's very simple and all credit goes to andrewgeek for the original code.

Please use 0.6 if you don't like the "oper oper oper oper" bit.

Version 0.5 supports Anope 1.8.5 to 1.8.5
Version 0.6 supports Anope 1.8.5 to 1.8.6
